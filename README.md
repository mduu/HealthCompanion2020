# HealthCompanion2020

The source-code repo for Health Hack Team "Health Companion".

## Project summary

Usually users have several apps for different needs. But these apps do not talk to each other. With our health companion we try to generate a holistic picture and to be able to give even more individualized advice and thus improve the quality of life in the long run.
